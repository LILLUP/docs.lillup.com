What is the &chain protocol ?
We tokenize one digital content provided by the creator (raw knowledge) by one knowledge graph produced by cloud computing. In the field of knowledge representation, a knowledge graph is a knowledge base modeling data in the form of a graphical representation. This knowledge graph is made up of keywords that reflect the knowledge acquired. A knowledge graph associated with a person therefore reflects his true knowledge. That’s a new asset class. The name of this token is Ampersand. The &chain protocol, which is a blockchain smart contract, is processing the Ampersand token through the blockchain.
How does it work ?
The digital content’s creator signs in in the Lillup Dapp and uploads its digital content. Lillup artificial intelligence produces the knowledge graph linked to the creator’s digital content. The &chain protocol generates the Ampersand token corresponding to and transfers it to the creator's wallet.
What problem does it solve ?
The &chain protocol disrupt the field of employment, way of working and learning impacted by the 4th Industrial Revolution. In a world where the race for skills is accelerating, the ability to guarantee the knowledge acquired by individuals is a new and non-existent value proposition. Thus, thanks to blockchain technology, we enable stakeholders to develop a new approach to human capital in the labour market.
And How can it be used ?
The creator transfers the ampersand token to the recipient, knowledge consumer. The learner, as recipient, by collecting ampersand tokens (knowledge graph), demonstrates evidences of his human capital. The Ampersand token is the DNA of the human capital, and supports the employability of learners and corporate human capital lifecycle. Stakeholders develop innovative services around Ampersand to serve employability and human capital.
